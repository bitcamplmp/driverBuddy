                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Maryland requires the use of ignition interlocks for repeat and high BAC (.15 BAC or greater) impaired driving offenders. Other first offenders have the option of using ignition interlocks or may be required at judicial discretion. Effective October 1, 2016, Maryland requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

A license may be renewed as much as 1 year ahead of its expiration date.
An application for driver’s license renewal may be submitted by means of personal appearance before the department or via mail or online if permitted by department rule and the applicant did not renew his or her license by mail or online when it last expired. If a qualified person submits an application by mail or online, he or she is not required to pass an examination nor provide an updated photograph.

A Washington driver’s license issued to a service member, or the spouse or dependent child living with the service member, remains in effect while the person is serving in the U.S. Armed Forces on active duty.
The license is valid until 90 days after the honorable discharge from service duty, unless it is suspended, cancelled, or revoked for cause as provided by law. If separation from the service is other than honorable, the military expiration is immediately void and you must apply for a renewal license. A license with a military expiration issued to a reservist who has been called to active duty, or the spouse or dependent child of the reservist, only remains in effect while the person remains on active duty.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol concentration (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Washington law specifies that drivers with 5 nanograms of active tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in their whole blood can be prosecuted for driving under the influence.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Washington requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.
Washington has an illegal per se limit for marijuana set at 5 ng/mL active THC.

                Driver's License Renewal
                A first license, or renewal of expired license within 1 year, is valid for 8 years.  A limited term license is valid for the licensee’s authorized length of stay in the United States as verified using the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program.
The DMV is required to provide reasonable notice of pending expiration by mail, unless the person’s license has been suspended, cancelled, or revoked, or the person has failed to notify the DMV of a change of address.  In addition, DMV is not required to notify the holder of a limited-term license of an approaching expiration date if the limited-term license was issued for a period of less than one year.
An application for renewal of an expired license must be completed within 1 year of expiration otherwise the licensee does not qualify for renewal and must apply as for an original license.
Drivers age 50 and over are subject to a vision screening at renewal.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Oregon requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Statewide, California requires the use of ignition interlocks for repeat and high BAC (.15 BAC or greater) offenders only. California has a pilot program in 4 counties that requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

                Graduated Driver's Licensing
                Idaho has a system of graduated licensing for novice drivers.
At age 14 and 6 months, individuals are eligible for a driver’s training instruction permit. The driver’s training instruction permit is held by the driver training instructor and the individual may only drive with the training instructor until the driver training course has been successfully completed. After successful completion of driver training, the permit is given to the individuals, which is then used as a supervised instruction permit.
During the supervised permit phase, individuals may only drive when supervised by a person who holds a valid driver’s license and is at least 21 years of age.
The supervising driver must be the only passenger in the front seat. Drivers must accumulate at least 50 hours (10 at night) of supervised driving over a minimum 6-month period.
At 15 years of age, individuals are eligible for a driver’s license if they have successfully completed an approved driver education course and have completed at least 50 hours of supervised driving over a minimum period of 6 months.
Drivers under 16 are restricted to daylight driving only, unless accompanied by a supervising person who holds a valid driver’s license and is at least 21 years of age. Daylight hours are considered as 1/2 hour before sunrise to 1/2 hour after sunset. There are no exceptions to this restriction.
Drivers under 17 are restricted to carrying no more than 1 passenger who is under 17 years of age during the first 6 months of licensure, unless the passenger is related by blood, marriage or adoption.
At age 17, or after the first 6 months of licensure, supervised driving is no longer required and drivers are eligible for an unrestricted license. Any violation, including an alcohol violation, during the supervised permit period, will result in cancellation of the permit. The individual must purchase a new permit and start the 6-month supervised driving period over again.
Driver education is required for all license applicants under age 17.

                Driver's License Issuance/Application
                A driver’s license is required prior to driving in the state.  Idaho has reciprocity with other states for driver’s licenses and permits, provided that all conditions of the licenses or permits are followed.
Licenses shall not be issued to persons under 18 years of age not enrolled in school, in vocational school, or in a job training program or not having satisfactorily completed school.
Driver’s licenses will contain a distinguishing number (not social security number), full name, date of birth, Idaho residence address, sex, weight, height, eye color, hair color, color photograph, dates of issuance and expiration, license class, endorsements, restrictions, and the applicant’s signature.
New residents who will be operating motor vehicles must obtain an Idaho license after establishing residency even if they hold a valid unexpired driver’s license from another state. This can occur before 90 days but residency is considered established after living 90 continuous days in Idaho (30 days for Commercial Driver’s licenses). Foreign visitors on a limited-time visa (90 days or less) are not considered Idaho residents and are not eligible for licensure in Idaho.

                All driver’s licenses for persons 21 years of age and over are renewable on or before expiration with application, payment of fee, and satisfactory completion of the required vision screening.
For persons 21 and over, the license shall expire on the licensee’s birthday 4 years after issuance. A person between the ages of 21 and 62 may opt to have their license expire on their birthday 4 or 8 years after issuance.
For persons under 18 years of age, the license shall expire 5 days after the licensee’s 18th birthday.
For persons between the ages of 18 and 21 years, the license shall expire 5 days after the licensee’s 21st birthday.
Vision will be checked at each renewal in person, and if the examiner thinks it is necessary, a skills test, visual examination and/or medical examination may be requested.
Drivers age 63 and older will have licenses expire on their birthday every 4 years.
Drivers age 70 and older must renew their license in person.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Idaho requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving repeat offenders only.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC).  All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Nevada requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

A manufactured home is considered an improvement to real property if the running gear is removed and it is attached to a permanent foundation on land that is owned or being purchased by the owner of the manufactured home or with the permission of the landowner.
To eliminate the certificate of ownership, the owner may file a statement of intent with the DOJ that includes: (1) the serial number of the manufactured home; (2) the legal description of the real property to which the home has been permanently attached; (3) a description of any liens; and (4) approval from all lienholders of the intent to eliminate the title.
Upon a transfer of any interest in a mobile home or house trailer, the application for the transfer must be made through the county treasurer’s office in the county in which the mobile home or house trailer is located at the time of transfer.

                Registration Application
                Each owner of a motor vehicle operated or driven on the public highways of the state must apply in the office of the county treasurer in the county where the owner permanently resides at the time of making the application for registration or re-registration.
The application must contain: (1) the name and address of the owner, giving the county, school district, and town or city within whose corporate limits the motor vehicle is taxable, if taxable, or within whose corporate limits the owner’s residence is located if the motor vehicle is not taxable; (2) the name and address of any lienholder; (3) a description of the motor vehicle; and (4) the declared weight of all trailers operating intrastate.
The applicant must pay at the time of making the application to the county treasurer the registration fee and the motor vehicle fees in lieu of tax or registration fees imposed against the vehicle for the current year of registration and the immediately previous year.
Mobile homes, motor homes, trucks exceeding a 1-ton capacity, trailers, buses, some commercial vehicles, government vehicles, and fleet vehicles are subject to staggered registration.
Vehicles subject to staggered registration that exceed a 1-ton capacity must be re-registered annually in the month in which they were first registered.
Owners of vehicles subject to staggered registration with a capacity of 1 ton or less may register the vehicle for a period not to exceed 24 months.
Owners of vehicles subject to staggered registration that are 11 years old or older may permanently register the vehicle.
Owners of vehicles subject to staggered registration have a grace period for registration that exists between the 1st and end of the month. Motor vehicles must be registered not later than the last day of the month corresponding to the anniversary registration period.
The owner of a new or transferred vehicle has a grace period of 20 calendar days from the date of purchase to make application and pay the registration fees, fees in lieu of taxes and other fees, and local option taxes, if applicable, as if the vehicle were being registered for the first time in the registration year.
If the vehicle was not purchased from a licensed motor vehicle dealer, the purchaser may operate the vehicle on public streets and highways without a certificate of registration for 20 calendar days, provided that at all times during that period, a vehicle purchase sticker obtained from the county treasurer or a law enforcement officer, showing the date of purchase, is clearly displayed in the rear window.
Failure to apply for a certificate of registration within 20 days subjects the purchaser of a motor vehicle to a penalty of $10.
Registration fees and new number plate fees do not apply when number plates are transferred to a replacement vehicle.
Montana residents on active military duty stationed outside Montana are not subject to registration fees and fees in lieu of taxes if they file the appropriate application for the exemption with the MVD.
All registrations of motor homes expire annually on April 30. Application for registration must be made by June 15. The owner of a motor home is entitled to operate the vehicle between May 1 and June 15 without displaying a registration certificate for the current registration year, if the owner displays the plates, or plate assigned for the previous year.
The owner of a light vehicle 11 years old or older may permanently register their vehicle upon payment of a $50 fee in lieu of tax, the applicable registration and license fees, a $2 surcharge, and an amount equal to 5 times the applicable fees imposed for: (1) junk vehicle disposal; (2) weed control; (3) former county motor vehicle computer; (4) local option vehicle tax or flat fee; (5) license plates; and (6) senior and disabled persons transportation services.

A person may not purchase or display on a vehicle a license plate bearing the number assigned to any county other than the county of the person’s permanent residence at the time of application of registration.
All number plates are issued for a maximum period of 4 years. In years when number plates are not issued, the MVD will provide non-removable stickers bearing appropriate registration numbers that must be affixed to the rear license plate.
License plates are validated by decals.
Any purchaser of a motor vehicle may obtain a temporary window sticker from the country treasurer if he or she is unable to complete the process of applying for a Montana title at the time he or she applies for registration of the vehicle because the certificate of ownership is lost, in the possession of third parties, or in the process of reissuance.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Montana requires the use of ignition interlocks for impaired driving repeat offenders only, though they may be required for first time offenders at judicial discretion.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Wyoming requires the use of ignition interlocks for repeat and high BAC (.15 BAC or greater) impaired driving offenders only.

                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Utah requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

For the first 6 months of licensure in the intermediate phase, individuals may not drive between the hours of midnight and 5 a.m. unless accompanied by a parent or legal guardian or traveling to or from a school, family or religious activity or other qualifying emergency (secondarily enforced).
During the first 6 months of licensure in the intermediate phase, individuals may not have more than 1 non-related passenger who is under age 18 unless accompanied by licensed parent or legal guardian (secondarily enforced).
At age 16 and 6 months, drivers who have held an intermediate license for at least 6 months are eligible for an unrestricted license.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Arizona requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

                Graduated Driver's Licensing
                Colorado has a system of graduated licensing for novice drivers.
The learner’s permit eligibility is based on age and driver education.
At age 15, individuals may drive with a learner’s (instruction) permit if they have completed and passed the classroom portion of a state-approved driver education course within 6 months of applying for their permit and they are accompanied by a parent, legal guardian, or driving instructor.
Individuals 15 1/2 years of age may drive with a learner’s permit if they are supervised by a parent, legal guardian, or driving instructor and have completed a 4-hour driver awareness course.
At age 16, individuals who choose not to enroll in any formal driver’s education course may drive with a learner’s permit.
Learner’s permit holders must hold the permit for 1 year and log at least 50 hours of supervised driving time (with 10 hours of night driving) before applying for a restricted license.
If there is no approved driving school within 30 miles of the permit holder’s residence, a learner’s permit holder between 15 and 15 1/2 years of age may alternatively complete either 6 hours of behind the wheel instruction or 12 hours parental supervised training.
During the restricted or intermediate license phase, licensees may not drive between midnight and 5 a.m. for the first year of licensure unless accompanied by a parent or legal guardian (secondarily enforced). Travel between the individual’s place of employment, education, or residence is exempt with a signed statement.
Drivers with intermediate licenses may not have any passengers under 21 years of age for the first 6 months of licensure, and only 1 non-family passenger under 21 during next 6 months of licensure (secondarily enforced).
At age 17, drivers are eligible for an unrestricted license.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Colorado law specifies that drivers with 5 nanograms of active tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in their whole blood can be prosecuted for driving under the influence.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Colorado requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

Written Test: There is a separate written test for each class of license. Applicants renewing a valid Nebraska operator’s license will have the written test waived if they renew the license prior to expiration or within 1 year after expiration. The examiner has access to Nebraska driver records and will determine eligibility upon application for renewal.
Driving Test: The driving test measures the ability to operate a specific class of vehicle under typical driving conditions. Examiners may, at their discretion, give a driving test to any license applicant. The vehicle must be furnished by the applicant for the driving test and it must be representative of the type of license for which he or she is applying.

Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.

Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.

The examination can also include anything else that the Department deems necessary.
The examination will be given either in the county where the applicant resides or at a place that is reasonably convenient to the applicant.

A driver’s license can be renewed when the applicant has passed an eye examination.
The Department may require any examination to determine the incompetence, physical or mental disability or disease of any licensed driver, or any conditions which would affect the driver from exercising reasonable and ordinary control over the motor vehicle. If, as a result of the examination, the Department believes that the driver is an unsafe person to operate a motor vehicle, the Department may cancel the driver’s license.
No examination shall be required only for the reason that any licensed driver has attained a certain age.

                Graduated Driver’s Licensing
                Minnesota has a system of graduated licensing for novice drivers.
At age 15, an individual is eligible for an instruction/learner’s permit. A permit can be issued if that person meets the following requirements: (1) has completed a driver’s education course in another state, has previously been issued a valid license from another state, or is enrolled in a certified driver education program that includes classroom and behind the wheel training; and (2) has completed the classroom phase of instruction in the driver education program and has passed an eye examination, and has passed a knowledge test.
The permit enables a person to operate a motor vehicle, but the applicant must be accompanied by a certified driver education instructor, the permit holder’s parent or guardian, or another licensed driver 21 years of age or older. The adult licensed driver must be sitting in the passenger seat next to the permit holder.
Instruction permit holders must accumulate at least 40 hours (15 at night)  of parental/guardian certified driving.  Instruction permit holders must provide an approved supervised driving log, plus 10 additional driving hours unless the primary driving supervisor has a certification of supplemental parental curriculum.
At age 16, after holding the instruction/learner’s permit for 6 months, drivers are eligible for a provisional license.
Provisional license holders may not drive between the hours of midnight and 5 a.m.
Provisional license holders are allowed no more than 1 passenger under age 20 for first 6 months of licensure, and no more than 3 passengers under age 20 for the next 6 months. Family members are exempt.
A person under 18 years of age is eligible for a driver’s license under 1 of the following conditions: (1) the applicant has a valid license from another state; or (2) the applicant has held a provisional license for 12 consecutive months before the license application and has incurred no conviction for a crash-related moving violation, and not more than 1 conviction for a moving violation that is not crash-related; and the application is approved by a parent or guardian.
Driver education is required for all license applicants under age 18.

First-time Minnesota applicants must present a primary and a secondary form of identification to verify both identity and residency status.
Visitors who are in the U.S. as temporary residents will have the words “Status Check” and a visa expiration date on their state-issued cards. Proof of extended authorization to remain in the country will be required when the authorization date indicated on a card expires. Immigrants granted permanent or indefinite residency will not have a status check designation appear on their state-issued cards.
Social Security Numbers are not displayed on licenses.
License includes a color photograph. All applicants must have a full-face photograph taken, with the face unobscured, as part of the identification process. This does not require the complete removal of headwear. However, individuals are required to pull headwear back far enough so as not to obscure the face.
Out-of-state driver’s licenses are viewed as secondary identification documents.
An applicant who is over 18 years of age who received an instruction permit, and has not been previously licensed to drive in Minnesota or any other jurisdiction, must possess the instruction permit for at least 3 months.
Any valid driver’s license issued to a person on active duty with the U.S. Armed Forces, or the person’s spouse, is effective without requirement for renewal until 90 days after the date of the person’s discharge from the service.

                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Minnesota requires the use of ignition interlocks for repeat and high BAC (.16 BAC or greater) impaired driving offenders only. Other first offenders have the option of using them.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Iowa requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders with a BAC of .10 or greater, though they may be required for offenders with a BAC of .08-.09 at judicial discretion.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Missouri requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Arkansas requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.

The emissions inspection is initially required beginning the 3rd year following the vehicle’s model year and every 2 years thereafter.
If a vehicle is more than 5 model years old at the time of an ownership change, the vehicle must be submitted for inspection within 45 days of an ownership change registration issuance, unless the vehicle passed inspection within 180 days prior to the ownership change registration.
OBD is utilized as part of the state emissions inspection process.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Illinois law specifies that drivers with 5 nanograms of active tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in their whole blood can be prosecuted for driving under the influence.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Illinois requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

                Graduated Driver's Licensing
                Kentucky has a system of graduated licensing for novice drivers.
At age 16, individuals are eligible for a learner’s permit.
During this stage, individuals may not drive unless supervised by a person 21 years of age or older, or a driving instructor on a driver training range.
Learner’s permit holders may not drive between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m. and may only have 1 unrelated passenger under 20 years of age.
At age 16 and 6 months, drivers who have held a permit for at least 6 months, accumulated 60 hours (10 at night) of parental/guardian certified driving are eligible to apply for an intermediate license.
Intermediate license holders may not drive between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m. unless they can demonstrate “good cause” for driving such as emergencies or participation in school or work-related activities.
Permit and intermediate license holders must complete a mandatory 4 hour graduated license safety class.
During the intermediate state, drivers are permitted only 1 unrelated passenger under 20 years of age (secondarily enforced).
At age 17, after holding an intermediate license for 6 months, drivers are eligible for an unrestricted license.
Under state law, 16-and 17-year olds who are identified for academic deficiency, have 9 or more unexcused absences from school, or who have dropped out will not be eligible to receive a learner’s permit or intermediate license. Drivers who already hold a permit or intermediate license can have it revoked for the same reasons.
Driver education is required for all license applicants under age 18.

An applicant for an identification card must indicate whether they possess an identification card, permit or license from another state or country. The applicant must surrender the card, permit or license from another state.
Non-residents that are at least 16 years old and are licensed in another state may operate a vehicle in Kentucky without obtaining a Kentucky learner’s permit or operator’s license as long as his or her home state accords similar privileges to licensed residents of Kentucky. If the non-resident’s home state does not afford such privileges to licensed residents of Kentucky, the non-resident may operate a motor vehicle, motorcycle, or moped for not more than 30 days in any 1 year without obtaining a Kentucky license.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Kentucky requires the use of ignition interlocks for repeat and high BAC (.15 or greater) impaired driving offenders, though they may be required for first time offenders at judicial discretion.

A license tag on a motor vehicle or trailer may be renewed for 5-year periods, except for vehicles registered in excess of 10,000 lbs. Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW).
During each intervening year of the period tags are issued, the State Tax Commission will issue 1 decal, in lieu of tags, that specifies the month and year that the tag will expire.
License decals shall indicate the month and last 2 figures of the year the license tag will expire and shall be color-coded to make it easier to distinguish month from year.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia have impaired driving laws that prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of impaired driving consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the impaired driving charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Alabama requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

The owners of new or unregistered vehicles are allowed 7 business days after the date of purchase to purchase a tag and/or renewal decal.
License plates and revalidation decals may be purchased by mail.
Metal license plates issued on or after January 1, 1997 are used for a period of 5 years, and a revalidation decal is issued in those years in which a metal plate is not issued.
The color scheme for license plates is black and white with peach emblem.
Defaced or illegible plates or renewal decals must be turned in at the time the replacement tag and/or renewal decal is issued. If replacement tags or decals were obtained for lost or stolen tags or decals, the original tags or decals must be immediately turned in to the Internal Administration Unit (IAU) of the DOR.
All passenger cars, including station wagons and other utility vehicles, including motorcycles, motor scooters, and buses, must display the reflectorized license plate assigned to it on the rear of the vehicle.
All trucks and trailers must, where practical, display the license plate on the rear of the vehicle. However, if the truck or trailer routinely engages in activities wherein it is inevitable that a license plate attached to the rear would be defaced, destroyed, or lost, the plate may be attached to the front.
Every motor vehicle must at all times have the license plate assigned to it firmly attached in such a manner that it will not swing and that it will be plainly visible. It is the duty of the operator to keep the license plate legible at all times. No license plate may be covered with any material unless the material is colorless and transparent.

The transferee of a motor vehicle may not use the license plate and renewal decal assigned to that vehicle unless the transferor also assigns the plate and decal to the transferee.
When the registered owner of a jointly owned vehicle is deceased, the license plate issued for the vehicle may be transferred to the surviving owner’s name, provided that the surviving owner acquires a new certificate of title.
The local tag agent can transfer or assign renewal decals and license plates for all license plates which they maintain in inventory. All other transfers must be mailed directly to the IAU of the DOR.
All tags and renewal decals are transferable to a new owner except dealer tags, amateur radio operator tags, handicapped veteran tags, National Guard tags, disabled veterans tags, citizens’ band radio tags, special prestige tags, foreign consuls’ tags, commanders of patriotic organizations tags, legislative tags, and other special tags.

Individuals at least 15 years of age may apply for an instruction/learner’s permit to operate a non-commercial Class C vehicle.
While driving, the permit holder must be accompanied by a person at least 21 years of age licensed to drive a Class C vehicle.
Novice drivers must hold the permit for at least 12 months and 1 day and pass a road test before being eligible for an intermediate license.
Instruction permit holders must accumulate 40 hours (including 6 at night) of supervised driving certified by a driving instructor, parent, or guardian.

Intermediate license holders may not drive between midnight and 6 a.m. — no exceptions.
During the first 6 months of the intermediate license, novice drivers are prohibited from transporting any non-immediate family members (secondarily enforced). During the 2nd 6 months, no more than 1 passenger under 21 (immediate family members exempt). Thereafter, intermediate license holders are prohibited from transporting more than 3 passengers who are non-family members under 21 (secondarily enforced).
At age 18, drivers are eligible for a full unrestricted license as long as they have had no major traffic convictions in the last 12 months. The intermediate license requirements apply to all applicants for an unrestricted license.
Drivers may only move from 1 stage of licensing to the next if they have completed 12 consecutive months without a conviction for 1 or more of the following: DUI, eluding a police officer, drag racing, reckless driving, hit and run, and any moving violation for which 4 or more points are assessed.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Georgia requires the use of ignition interlocks for impaired driving repeat offenders only.

If you buy a vehicle with an Indiana title, or receive as a gift a vehicle with an Indiana title, you must title it in your own name within 31 days.
If you have recently purchased a vehicle with an out-of-state title, or received as a gift a vehicle with an out-of-state title, you must title it in Indiana within 31 days. If you are a new Indiana resident, you must title your vehicles in Indiana within 60 days of becoming an Indiana resident.
If a certificate of title was previously issued for the vehicle in Indiana, then the application for certificate of title must be accompanied by the previously issued certificate of title. If that certificate of title does not exist, then the application must be accompanied by the manufacturer’s certificate of origin.
If a certificate of title was not previously issued for the vehicle in Indiana, the application for the certificate must be accompanied by the certificate of title issued for the vehicle from another state. If that state does not have a certificate of title law, a sworn bill of sale or dealer’s invoice fully describing the vehicle and the most recent registration receipt issued for the vehicle must accompany the application.
The Bureau will deliver a certificate of title to the person who owns the vehicle if no lien or encumbrances appear on the certificate of title.
In Indiana, a certificate of title is required for all motor vehicles, mobile homes, trailers and recreational vehicles.

                Graduated Driver’s Licensing
                Indiana has a system of graduated licensing for novice drivers.
At age 15, a learner’s permit may be issued if the applicant is enrolled in an approved driver education course, or age 16 without driver education.
This permit allows a holder to operate a motor vehicle while the holder is participating in an approved driver education course, with a certified driving instructor in the front seat of a vehicle equipped with dual brake controls, or when a licensed driver at least 25 years old and related by blood, marriage or legal status, or a spouse over age 21 with valid driving privileges is seated in the vehicle’s front passenger seat. If the permit holder is at least 18 years or older, they may also drive with any non-relative who is at least age 25 with valid driving privileges.
If the learner’s permit applicant is school age, and either habitually misses class, is under suspension for a second time during the same school year, is under expulsion from school, or withdrawn from school for reasons other than proven financial hardship, then the applicant is not eligible to receive his or her learner’s permit until age 18.
Regardless of age, the permit holder must hold the permit for 180 days and complete 50 hours of certified driving practice (10 hours at night) before receiving an intermediate license.
Drivers are eligible for an intermediate license at age 16 years and 90 days upon successful completion of an approved driver education program or 16 years and 270 days without driver education.
During the first 180 days of the intermediate stage, unless accompanied by a licensed adult over the age of 25, or a spouse over the age of 21, or for lawful employment, school sanctioned activities, or a religious event, individuals under age 21 may not drive between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. Thereafter, until age 18, individuals may not drive between the hours of 1 a.m and 5 a.m. Saturday and Sunday (“late night” Friday and Saturday) or between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. Sunday through Friday.
Also, intermediate license holders under age 21 may not have any passengers other than a sibling, step-sibling, their child or step-child, or spouse of the driver for the first 180 days, unless supervised by a licensed instructor, licensed driver with valid driving privileges at least 25 years old or if the licensed driver is the holder’s spouse, age 21.
At age 21, drivers are eligible for an unrestricted driver’s license. Intermediate licenses automatically expire 30 days after a driver’s 21st birthday.

Military families are the only Indiana motorists who have the privilege of renewing by mail

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Indiana requires the use of ignition interlocks for impaired driving repeat offenders, though they may be required for first time offenders at judicial discretion.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Michigan requires the use of ignition interlocks for repeat and high BAC (.17 BAC or greater) impaired driving offenders only.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Ohio requires the use of ignition interlocks for repeat impaired driving offenders only, though they may be required for first time offenders at judicial discretion.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Florida requires the use of ignition interlocks for repeat and high BAC (.15 BAC or greater) offenders only.

                Graduated Driver's Licensing
                South Carolina has a system of graduated licensing for novice drivers.
At age 15, individuals are eligible for a beginner’s permit.
Beginner’s permit holders may drive from 6 a.m. to midnight if a licensed driver who is at least 21 years old and has at least 1 year of driving experience accompanies the driver in the front seat. Beginner’s permit holders may drive from midnight to 6 a.m. if a licensed parent or guardian accompanies him or her in the front seat.
Permit holders must accumulate 40 hours (10 hours at night) of supervised driving.
At 15 and 6 months, drivers are eligible for a conditional/restricted license if they have: (1) passed a certified driver’s education course; (2) successfully passed a road test; and (3) satisfied the school attendance requirement.
Restricted license holders may drive alone during daylight hours from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m. (or 8 p.m. during daylight savings time). From 6 p.m. (or 8 p.m. during daylight savings time) until midnight, the restricted license holder must be accompanied by a licensed driver who is at least 21 years of age. Between midnight and 6 a.m., restricted license holders may drive if a licensed parent or legal guardian accompanies them.
Drivers may not transport more than 2 passengers under the age of 21 unless they are accompanied by a licensed adult who is at least 21 years old. Family members and fellow students being transported to and from school are exempt.
At age 16 and 6 months, drivers are eligible for an unrestricted license. Drivers applying for a full unrestricted license must have held a restricted license for 1 year and have no traffic offenses or have ever been involved in any at-fault collisions.
Driver education is required for all license applicants under age 17.

                Driver's License Issuance/Application
                Every application for a driver’s license or permit must: (1) be made upon the form furnished by the Department; (2) be accompanied by the proper fee and any identification required by the Department; (3) contain the full name, date of birth, sex, race, and residence address of the applicant and briefly describe the applicant; (4) state whether the applicant has been licensed as an operator or chauffeur and, if so, when and by what state or country; and (5) state whether a license or permit has been suspended or revoked or whether an application has been refused and, if so, the date of and reason for the suspension, revocation, or reason for refusal.
School attendance is a requirement for the issuance of a conditional license. The Department may not issue a license to a person unless the person has a high school diploma or certificate, or a General Education Development Certificate, or is enrolled in a public or private school which has been approved by the State Board of Education or a member school of the South Carolina Independent School’s Association, a parochial, denominational, church-related school, or other programs which are accepted by the State Board of Education. Also to obtain a conditional license a person must do the following: (1) conform to the attendance laws, regulations, and policies of the school, school district, and the State Board of Education, as applicable; and (2) the person must not be suspended or expelled from school.
The Department may issue a special restricted driver’s license to a person who is between 16 years of age and 17 years of age, who has held a beginner’s permit for 180 days and who has successfully passed the road test or other requirements the Department may require. The special restricted driver’s license allows the license holder to operate a vehicle between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. (or 8 p.m. during daylight savings time). The holder of a special restricted driver’s license may not drive between midnight and 6 a.m., unless accompanied by the holder’s licensed parent or guardian. The restrictions on a special restricted license may be modified or waived by the Department if the restricted licensee proves to the Department’s satisfaction that the restriction interferes with the license holder’s employment, opportunity for employment, or ability to attend school.
License includes a color photograph. Social security number is not displayed on license.
The following persons do not have to obtain a beginner’s/learner’s permit to operate a motor vehicle: (1) students regularly enrolled in a South Carolina high school that conducts a driver’s training course while the student is participating in the course and when accompanied by a qualified instructor of the course; and (2) a person 15 years or older enrolled in a driver training course conducted by a licensed driver training school. This person must be accompanied by an instructor of the school and can only drive the school’s automobile.
The expiration dates on non-citizens’ driver’s licenses and I.D. cards are linked to the expiration date of the person’s visa.

The Department requires all applicants obtaining their initial license to take a vision test. The vision examination can be waived if the license holder submits a certificate from a person authorized by law to examine eyes. When renewing a license, certification that the vision of the person screened meets the minimum standards required by the department or have been corrected to meet these requirements if a screening is required.
The department may renew a driver’s license of a resident by mail or electronically upon payment of the required fee, if the renewal is a digitized license.
Any person licensed to drive a motor vehicle in this state who is involved in 4 accidents in any 24-month period, may, at the discretion of the Department, be required to take any portion of the driver’s license examination. Any person who has had 4 accidents and fails to submit to such test within 30 days after having been notified by the Department will have his or her driver’s license suspended until he or she takes and passes the examination.
If a person’s license expires and he is unable to renew it before its expiration date because he is on active military duty outside this State for a continuous period of at least 30 days immediately before the expiration date or because he is the spouse or dependent living for a continuous period of at least 30 days immediately before the expiration date with a person on active military duty outside this State, within 60 days after returning to this State, the person may renew his license in the manner permitted by this section as though the license had not expired. The department may require proof from the person that he qualifies for renewal of his license under this paragraph. Upon request, the person shall provide the department with a copy of his military service record, a document of his branch of military service showing the date of active military duty outside the State, or other evidence presented by the person showing the dates of service.
Any valid driver’s license issued to a person on active duty out of the state, or the person’s spouse, is effective without requirement for renewal until 90 days after the date of the person’s discharge from the service.
For cause shown, the department may require the submission by the applicant of evidence satisfactory to the department of the applicant’s mental and physical fitness to drive and his knowledge of traffic laws and regulations. If the evidence is not satisfactory to the department, the department may require an examination of the applicant as upon an original application. Parallel parking is not required as a part of the driver’s test.
The renewal license forms distributed by the department must be designed to contain a certification that the vision of the person screened meets the minimum standards required by the department or have been corrected to meet these requirements if a screening is required. The certification must be executed by the person conducting the screening. The minimum standards of the department shall not require a greater degree of vision than 20/40 corrected in one eye.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
South Carolina requires the use of ignition interlocks for repeat and high BAC (.15 BAC or greater) impaired driving offenders only. Other first offenders have the option of using ignition interlocks.

The requirements apply when: (1) a clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train; (2) a crossing gate is lowered or when a flagman gives or continues to give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train; (3) a railroad train approaching within approximately 1,500 feet of the highway crossing emits a signal audible from such distance and the train, by reason of its speed or nearness to the crossing, is an immediate hazard; or (4) an approaching railroad train is plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to the crossing.
﻿A person must not drive any vehicle through, around, or under any crossing gate or barrier at a railroad crossing while the gate or barrier is closed or is being opened or closed.
The DOT and local authorities with the approval of DOT may designate particularly dangerous highway grade crossings of railroads and erect stop signs at those crossings. When such signs are erected, the driver of any vehicle must stop between 15 and 50 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and must proceed with care.
Notwithstanding the indication of a traffic signal to proceed, a driver must not enter an intersection, a marked crosswalk, or drive onto a railroad grade crossing unless there is sufficient space on the other side of the intersection, crosswalk, or railroad grade crossing to accommodate the vehicle the driver is operating without obstructing the passage of the other vehicles, pedestrians, or railroad trains.
When stopping as required at a railroad crossing, the driver must keep as far to the right of the highway as possible and must not form 2 lanes of traffic unless the roadway is marked for 2 or more lanes of traffic on the driver’s side of the center line of the highway.

                Graduated Driver's Licensing
                North Carolina has a system of graduated licensing for novice drivers.
At age 15, individuals who pass driver education and a written test, and have a driving eligibility certificate are eligible for a learner’s permit.
Permit holders may not drive unsupervised.
For the first 6 months, the permit holder may only drive between the hours of 5 a.m. and 9 p.m.
Every person riding in the vehicle operated by a permit holder must either be wearing a properly fastened safety belt or be safely restrained in a child passenger restraint system.
Permit holders must complete 60 hours of practice driving (including 10 hours at night).
At age 16, after passing a road test, earning a driving eligibility certificate, and holding a learner’s permit for at least 12 months, individuals may obtain a limited provisional license.
Provisional license holders may drive unsupervised between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. or at any time when driving directly to or from work or as a member of a volunteer fire, rescue or emergency medical service. At all other times, drivers must be supervised by a parent, guardian, grandparent, or a person approved by any of them, who has been licensed for at least 5 years.
Provisional license holders are restricted from transporting more than 1 passenger under 21 unless accompanied by a supervising driver (family exempted). However, individuals transporting family members under 21 may not transport any other passengers under 21 unless supervised.
Every person riding in the vehicle operated by a provisional license holder must either be wearing a properly fastened safety belt or be safely restrained in a child passenger restraint system.
At 16 years and 6 months, drivers are eligible for an unrestricted license if they have: (1) held a provisional license for at least 6 months; (2) not been convicted of a moving violation or seat belt infraction during the preceding 6 months; (3) completed 12 hours of practice driving (including 6 at night); and (4) a driver eligibility certificate.
Driver education is required for all license applicants under age 18.

                Driver's License Issuance/Application
                A new resident of North Carolina who has a valid driver’s license from another jurisdiction must obtain a North Carolina driver’s license within 60 days of becoming a resident.
To obtain a driver’s license, an applicant must complete an application, present at least 2 forms of identification, be a North Carolina resident, and demonstrate his physical and mental ability to drive a motor vehicle safely.
A driver’s license application must contain the applicant’s full name; mailing address and residence address; a physical description including sex, height, eye color, and hair color; date of birth; social security number; and the applicant’s signature.
The DMV may not issue a license to a person until that person has furnished proof of financial responsibility.
A driver’s license issued by the DMV must be tamperproof and must also contain a color photograph of the license holder and an identifying number for the license holder that is not the holder’s social security number.
A person whose address or name changes shall notify the DMV within 60 days after the change occurs.
An application for a commercial license must include the same information as a regular license, as well as consent to release the applicant’s driving record.
A first driver’s license may be issued for period shorter than 4 years if the DMV determines that a license of shorter duration should be issued because the applicant holds a visa of limited duration issued by the United States Department of State.
The expiration dates on non-citizen’s driver’s licenses and ID cards are linked to the expiration date of the person’s visa.

                Driver’s License Renewal
                Applicants for renewal prior to the license expiring may not be required to take a written or road test unless the applicant has been convicted of a traffic violation since the person’s license was last issued or the applicant suffers from a mental or physical condition that impairs the person’s ability to drive a vehicle.
A current or expired license is required at renewal. In the absence of a license, an applicant for renewal must present two documents of identification.
A driver’s license issued to a person at least 18 years old but less than 66 years old expires eight years after the date it was issued. A driver’s license issued to a person at least 66 years old expires five years after the date it was issued.  Licenses may be renewed remotely every other renewal. Vision testing is required at in-person renewals.
The first license the DMV issues to a person expires on the person’s 4th or subsequent birthday that occurs after the license is issued and on which the individual’s age is evenly divisible by 5.
Before a license expires, the DMV mails a reminder card explaining the number of years it will be valid. The reminder card is not required in order to renew. If DMV does not have your social security number on file, you must present your social security card at the time of issuance. If you are not eligible for a social security card, you must present documentation issued by the US Government indicating legal presence. If you do not have your current or expired license at renewal, you will be required to show the examiner two required documents of identification.
Resident on active duty or their dependents may renew their driver’s license by mail no more than two times during a license holder’s lifetime. A driver’s license with a military designation on it issued to a person on active duty may be renewed up to 1 year prior to its expiration upon presentation of military or Department of Defense credentials.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
North Carolina requires the use of ignition interlocks for repeat and high BAC (.15 BAC or greater) impaired driving offenders only.

Inspections must be done on a biennial basis at official emissions inspection stations. This rule does not apply to motorcycles, “clean fuel” vehicles, hybrid cars, antique vehicles, or vehicles 4 years old or less.
A vehicle will qualify for a waiver if it has failed an initial inspection and subsequently fails a re-inspection if the owner provides written proof that at least $175 was spent on improvements to a pre-1980 model vehicle or $200 for 1980 and newer vehicles; and that any emissions control system which has been removed, damaged, or rendered inoperable has been replaced and restored to operating condition.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Virginia requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

Permit holders under age 18 may not drive between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. and may not carry more than 2 passengers in addition to the supervisory driver.
Permit holders must complete 50 hours (including 10 hours at night) of certified practice driving, as recorded on a certification form completed by a parent or legal guardian.
At age 16, after holding a learner’s permit for 6 months and passing a road test, drivers are eligible for an intermediate license.
Intermediate license holders may not drive a vehicle unsupervised between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.
Intermediate license holders are prohibited from transporting passengers under the age of 20 during the first 6 months.  During the second 6 months, no more than 1 passenger under 20, except family members.
If a driver with an intermediate license receives 2 or more moving violations, the license will be suspended until age 18.
At age 17, drivers are eligible for an unrestricted license if they hold an intermediate license and have been infraction-free for 1 year.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
West Virginia requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

A license issued to a driver under the age of 21 shall expire 60 days after the driver’s 21st birthday.
The MVA may renew a license within 1 year after the expiration date without requiring a driving test.

The MVA shall require every individual age 40 and older applying for renewal of a license to pass a vision test. The vision test may be waived if the applicant has passed an acceptable vision examination within the last 12 months.
Applicants age 70 and older must provide proof of previous satisfactory operation of a vehicle or physician’s certificate of fitness.
People out of state during the renewal process may renew by mail. A valid non-photo license is issued to people who renew by mail. The license must be exchanged for a photo license within 15 days after returning to the state.
A license held by active military personnel or a dependent outside of the state is valid for 30 days after re-entering the state. The license can also be renewed by mail.

                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Maryland requires the use of ignition interlocks for repeat and high BAC (.15 BAC or greater) impaired driving offenders. Other first offenders have the option of using ignition interlocks or may be required at judicial discretion. Effective October 1, 2016, Maryland requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

                Delaware has a system of graduated licensing for novice drivers.
At age 16, individuals who have successfully completed an approved driver education course and have passed both a written and road skills test are eligible for a learner’s permit.
A learner’s permit holder must be supervised by a licensed driver age 25 or older riding in the front passenger seat and who has held a Class D license for at least 5 years.
No passengers other than the adult supervisor and 1 other passenger may be in the vehicle during the first 12 months of holding the learner’s permit (immediate family members are exempt).
After 6 months, learner’s permit holders are eligible for an intermediate license as long as they have completed 50 hours (10 at night) of supervised driving time.
In the intermediate stage, drivers may drive unsupervised between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Intermediate stage drivers may drive between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. only when supervised, unless they are traveling to or from church activities, work activities, or the license holder’s school.
Intermediate license holders may not transport more than 1 passenger who is not a family member.
At the age of 17 and after 6 months of holding an intermediate license, a driver in the intermediate stage may apply for a Class D license.
Driver education is required for all license applicants under 18.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Delaware requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

                New Jersey residents are required to have a valid New Jersey driver license to operate a motor vehicle. First-time drivers must complete the Graduated Driver License program to obtain a basic license, requiring applicants to pass various tests.
State law requires every licensed driver to pass a vision screening successfully (20/50 visual acuity required) at least once every 10 years as a condition of driver’s license renewal, but this provision is not currently enforced.
When a written examination is given as part of a high school driver education program, a certified driver education instructor, or special education teacher may be allowed to read the examination to any student who has been diagnosed with a deficiency in reading, perception, or other learning disability.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
New Jersey requires the use of ignition interlocks for repeat and high BAC (.15 BAC or greater) impaired driving offenders, though they may be required for other first time offenders at judicial discretion.

                Graduated Driver’s Licensing
                Connecticut has a system of graduated licensing for novice drivers.
At age 16, individuals are eligible for a learner’s permit.
During this stage individuals may only drive when accompanied by a licensed parent or guardian, an adult at least 20 years old who has held a driver’s license for at least 4 or more suspension-free consecutive years, or a driving instructor.
Drivers must hold the permit for at least 6 months (4 months if enrolled in driver education) and complete 40 hours of certified practice driving (8 hours of which must be done with a commercial driving school) before being eligible for an unrestricted license.
At age 16, drivers are eligible for an intermediate license.
During the first 6 months with this license, drivers are permitted no passengers other than a licensed parent or guardian, a licensed driving instructor giving instruction, and adult at least 20 years old who has held a driver’s license for four or more consecutive suspension-free years.
During the driver’s second 6 months, all immediate family members are permitted as the only passengers. Permit holders are also restricted from driving between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.
In addition, learner’s permit and provisional license holders may not transport more passengers than the number of seatbelts in the vehicle or operate any vehicle that requires a public passenger transportation permit or a vanpool vehicle.
At age 18, drivers who complete the graduated driver’s license system are eligible for an unrestricted license. Parents or legal guardians are also required to complete a 2-hour class concerning novice driver laws and safe driving practices.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Connecticut requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Rhode Island requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

At age 16 and 6 months, drivers are eligible for a junior operator’s/intermediate license who have: (1) held a permit for a period of 6 months; (2) completed an approved driver’s education course; (3) completed 40 or more (30 if an approved driver skills development program is completed) additional hours of behind-the-wheel experience driving supervised by a licensed driver age 21 or older; and (4) a clean driving record for a minimum of 6 months.
Junior operator’s/intermediate license holders are prohibited from driving unsupervised between the hours of 12:30 a.m. and 5 a.m. (secondarily enforced).
For the first 6 months of the junior operator’s/intermediate license phase, drivers may not transport any      passengers (other than family members) under the age of 18 unless supervised by a licensed driver age 21 or older (secondarily enforced).
A junior operator’s/intermediate license holder who violates the passenger restriction shall be subject to a license suspension of up to 60 days.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Massachusetts requires the use of ignition interlocks for impaired driving repeat offenders only.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Vermont requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
New Hampshire requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Maine requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

Provisional license holders are restricted from driving between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. and transporting passengers under age 21, with the exception of family members.

                Impaired Driving
                All 50 states and the District of Columbia have impaired driving laws that prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, with the illegal per se limit set at 0.08 percent blood alcohol content (.08 BAC). All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of impaired driving consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Alaska requires the use of ignition interlocks for all impaired driving offenders.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia set the legal drinking age at 21.
Every state’s chemical test law has ‘‘an implied consent’’ provision providing that any person operating a motor vehicle on a public highway, who is suspected of driving while intoxicated, consents to a chemical test to determine if he or she is inebriated. Failure to submit or pass such a test may cause the driver’s license to be suspended or revoked regardless of any court action finding the person innocent of the charge.
The most comprehensive resource on U.S. impaired driving laws is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Digest of Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws.  NHTSA’s Digest is updated annually.
Washington, D.C. does not require the use of ignition interlocks for impaired driving offenders but offenders have the option of using them.
